			<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Blind Fighting</h5>
			<p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Interception</h5>
			<p>When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Blessed Fighting</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.</p>
